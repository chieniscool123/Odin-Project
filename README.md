### What I learned: 
#### 1. JavaScript if/else, switch case, prompt, mathfloor, math.random
#### 2. prompt alwasy returned a string
#### 3. mathfloor static method always rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
#### 4. math.random is a static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Never reach 1 is important
#### 5.  let num = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3) + 1; will return a random number from 1 - 3

#### 2. prompt alwasy returned a string
#### 3. mathfloor static method always rounds down and returns the largest integer less than or equal to a given number.
#### 4. math.random is a static method returns a floating-point, pseudo-random number that's greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1. Never reach 1 is important
